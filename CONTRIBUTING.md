# Contributing to UFC Management Simulator

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! 🎮  
This is a solo-built UFC management simulation game in Python using Kivy and JSON — and I'm excited to see what ideas others might have to improve it.

If you have an idea or improvement (new feature, bug fix, UI tweak, etc.):

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Make your changes**
3. **Open a Pull Request** with:
   - A clear description of the change

**Note:** I'm curating the direction of this project, so not all contributions will be merged — but all are welcome and appreciated!

## 📁 Code Style

Please try to follow these basic conventions:
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions modular (avoid huge blocks of code)
- Comment anything that may not be obvious
- Stick to the existing project structure (unless proposing a better one)
